            <p class="text" id="text1">Venom is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel
                Comics. The character is a sentient alien symbiote with an amorphous, liquid-like form, who survives by
                bonding with a host, usually human. This dual-life form receives enhanced powers and usually refers to
                itself as "Venom". The symbiote was originally introduced as a living alien costume in The Amazing
                Spider-Man #252 (May 1984), with a full first appearance as Venom in The Amazing Spider-Man #300 (May
                1988).</p>

            <p class="text" id="text2">The Venom symbiote's first human host was Spider-Man himself, who eventually
                discovered its true nefarious nature and separated himself from the creature in The Amazing Spider-Man
                #258 (November 1984)[2]â€”with a brief rejoining five months later in Web of Spider-Man #1.[3] The
                symbiote went on to merge with other hosts, beginning with Eddie Brock, its second and best-known host,
                with whom it first became Venom</p>

            <p class="text" id="text2">A fan-favorite character and well-known figure in popular culture, Venom
                (primarily the Eddie Brock incarnation) is the most recognizable Spider-Man antagonist not first
                introduced during the original Lee/Ditko run. He has been featured in various media adaptations of
                Spider-Man over the years, including feature films, television series and video games. The character was
                portrayed by Tobey Maguire and Topher Grace in Spider-Man 3 (2007), with Tom Hardy primarily portraying
                the character in the Sony's Spider-Man Universe films Venom (2018) and Venom: Let There Be Carnage
                (2021), as well as an uncredited post-credit scene appearance in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film
                Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021).</p>
